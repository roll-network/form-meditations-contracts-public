# form-meditations-contracts-public
Form is a SocialFi L2 built using the OP stack. Meditations is a campaign to bring users and assets to the Form blockchain.

The core of the Meditations campaign is a staking contract. The staking contract allows anyone to stake any amount of certain allowed assets. The users are always in control of their funds - netiher the staking contract nor any admin address should be able to move funds on behalf of the users without the user's explicit consent. The users should also be able to withdraw their staked funds at any time.

Any asset migration will happen with explicit user consent.
